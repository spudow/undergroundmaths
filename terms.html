<p>We normally show your name or username (and school if applicable) with submissions you may make to the Site unless you request otherwise, but for operational reasons this is not always possible.</p>
<p>We may refuse to grant you a username that impersonates someone else, is or may be protected by trademark or other intellectual property rights, is offensive or otherwise inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Information you provide to us as part of our registration process will be treated in accordance with our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>. As part of these Policies, we may use your personal information provided upon registration to contact you with more information about the Site and any of its features or services.   We may also invite you to participate in surveys and discussions via online and offline surveys and discussion forums.  We also use personal information in aggregate form (so that no user is identified by name) to audit how the Site is being used and to help with our strategic development of the Site.  Participation in surveys and discussion forums is entirely voluntary. You may unsubscribe from being contacted for these purposes at any time by letting us know by contacting us using the contact details provided at the end of the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h3>User Contributions to the Site </h3>

By submitting a Contribution you acknowledge that you waive any moral rights you may have in it.</p>
<p>If the Contribution is made available to the public in the Site, you grant other users of the Site a limited licence to use, store and distribute your Contribution and make it available to others, without your permission, in any medium throughout the world. </p>
